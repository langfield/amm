An automated market maker is a program (a contract) that sets the price of a collection of cryptocurrency tokens. Investors give their assets to the contract, which are held in a "pool". When a user wishes to make a trade, the contract (1) computes an exchange rate, (2) receives the payment tokens (which are added to the appropriate pool) and (3) pays out the desired tokens (from a different pool). In exchange for keeping the pools sufficiently full, investors earn a bit of extra money, which is derived from the transaction fees collected by the contract. In this blog post, we attempt formal verification of a simple [StarkNet](https://starkware.co/starknet/) automated market maker (AMM) using Horus, an open-soure CLI tool that uses SMT (satisfiability modulo theory) solvers to check user-defined program properties. The example contract is available [on Github](https://github.com/NethermindEth/horus-checker/blob/master/tests/resources/golden/toy_amm/toy_amm_split.cairo). A working familarity with the StarkNet ecosystem is assumed in what follows.
